## What is this?
I thought I should put together a base CSS file for myself because I often find myself writing the same code over and over again. I present to you, Basket.css. This small CSS file is a great way to start a new project. All it is is a responsive grid and basic type styles. No clutter. Just a blank canvas to start work on.

## How can I use this?
Use this just like you would any other CSS file. All you need to do is apply the appropriate class in your HTML file.

## License
You can use this freely in whatever project you want. You can build on it, modify it to suit your needs and use it in commercial products. Please do not redistribute it on another server or pass it off as your own work however.
